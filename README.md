# Project Description

The project is a DES encoder and decoder tool that supports both CBC and ECB modes of encryption.
<!--- maybe we add an option to see the encryption step-by-step (like a flag or smth) --->

# Directions

At this time, no libraries are needed to run the code.
Use the makefile to run the code in the following format:
``` bash
make encrypt MESSAGE KEY
```
<!---[tentative, might make parameters]--->
<!---You will be prompted to enter a message, then a key.
The output will then be printed to terminal.--->

<!--
Commits
Please make sure you commit your work every day. When writing code, commit much more frequently. You have class time, AND homework time to work on this, your efforts should reflect this.)

To make things easier for all parties involved, here are some more clear documentation requrements.

Contents
Your repository should contain the following.

README.md
Your project description.
Directions on how to use/access all parts of the project (including compilation steps + library installation)
Links to the PRESENTATION + HOMEWORK md files.
WORKLOG.md
A per person daily log of what you did at home + in class (starting 5/19)
You must update this daily to reflect what you did. DO NOT keep a separate log and copy it over at the end.
A complete list of references and resoures you used.
PRESENTATION.md : Create your presentation/lesson "slides"
HOMEWORK.md : The assignment/activity you plan on having the other students do on their own. This will be submitted on google classroom or a TryHackMe room. If it is text based make clear deliverables ( such as "How many X does...", "find the flags", or "write out the steps you took to ...")
subdirectories : Place any code/scripts that you write in appropriate sub directories.
Note: You must use appropriate git markdown for formatting of your md files. Headers, links, code snippet highlights, etc.

Grade breakdown
40% - (project) The stuff you made (Lesson/Algorithms/tools/demos, etc.)

20% - (communication) Presentation* + Homework assigned to class.

20% - (documentation) Auxiliary Documentation and formatting

20% - (effort distributions) regular commits, appropriate commit messages, working over time, not procrastinating, both members working.

* both the document quality and the action of presenting in class, including: did both members present approximately equally?
