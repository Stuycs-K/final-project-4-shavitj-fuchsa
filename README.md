# Project Description

The project is a DES encoder tool that supports encryption of 8 bytes.
<!--- maybe we add an option to see the encryption step-by-step (like a flag or smth) --->

# Directions

At this time, no libraries are needed to run the code.
Use the makefile to run the code in the following format:
``` bash
make encrypt ARGS="MESSAGE KEY"
```
<!---[tentative, might make parameters]--->
<!---You will be prompted to enter a message, then a key.
The output will then be printed to terminal.--->
